    "text": "Today we are launching a new solar company that brings 2-axis tracking to commercial rooftops. This boosts the output of panels by 31%, and the economics by more than 20%.

I&#39;m assuming it is using the same plastic as the Makerbot? How about a store with pre-made drawings to buy and just print/produce (Like Shapeways)?<br /><br />Also do you have CAD software that makes it easy to use this and prompts everyone to just buy it, for the heck of it, ala Knowledge Adventure? Or does it only work with the expensive and professional CAD software out there?<br /><br />I think these couple of things can make this a mainstream product, just like the scanners and fax machines that made things easy in the 90&#39;s."

The large scale experiment - the scaleable company that we were building - pretty much failed, ended up being rebuilt form the ground up on a different basis using contractor labor, in part because I had neither identified nor solved these problems and in part because we were working inside an existing organizational structure and not all the systems for necessary\u00a0decentralization and elimination of single points of failure could be implemented. \u00a0<br /><br />As much as the article&#39;s text, the image you chose to illustrate it speaks to the most interesting approach to this problem I have seen anyone take to date.<br /><br />About 20 years ago, a good friend was running a nonprofit with a chronically dysfunctional board of directors. He gained access to a big pulling boat - 8 or 10 big oars on a lifeboat sized wooden hull - I think it was a replica of one of the launches on Capt Vancouver&#39;s ship - and he took the board out for a spin and steered them into serious currents, way out in the bay, and then disabled the rudder. \u00a0At which point they really had no choice (other than a tow from the Coast Guard) but to cooperate - at a truly physical level - to &quot;listen&quot; with their arms and backs and legs to one another&#39;s muscles on the other oars, and coordinate their efforts if they were to get back to the harbor. But whether or not a single experience like that can really change the way people deal with one another is another matter entirely."

What a great market! Never mind that more then 300 million &quot;people&quot; still don&#39;t have any phone which is basically market the size of USA. India the same. So yeah, there is shit load of sold phones in there, but still huge (and by huge I mean really HUGE) chunk of market without any phone. That&#39;s because those people are poor. Do you mean that based on this graph you can see business opportunity? Well good luck competing with cheap phones made in India and China.\u00a0<br />I&#39;m from Slovakia. Small country with population about 5.5 million. So we would need 15 phones for every citizen to make that chart. And I can tell you for a fact that there is more phones then citizens in Slovakia. So if you would take it by population/phone ratio you would clearly get really different graph. But it wouldn&#39;t tell you anything either. IMHO"

Sure we all like new things, but I believe it is people seeing something that can fundamentally change the way we do things and interact.  We get to define our social network and what we do inside of them.  <br /><br />I think the explosion (which will grow exponentially) will be because people will see the possibilities. Just today I was speaking with my son about this and related how many years ago (90&#39;s hahaha) there where pioneers who took the technology and changed the world.  <br /><br />Today, the social network is begging, crying out for pioneers to change the world.  I think Google is providing the conduit for us to ... well frankly...Dream Big!<br /><br />This world is about to shrink and we must give a round of applause for the ones who paved the way (myspace and facebook).<br /><br />Bill can you imagine being able to interact in  ways you never could dream.  Just for me, I find it amazing to be speaking with you because I&#39;ve been a huge fan of idealabs for a long long time.  Now I have the ability to reach out to you...how cool is that.<br /><br />who knows, maybe someday we could collaborate on a project.  How crazy!"

I started going down side-streets and back alleys to where I heard activity and motion. I was more or less zig-zagging my way to Las Ramblas, where there's always a lot of activity. But I didn't want to go right there. During the weaving, I found this enormous cathedral nestled between a square of classical looking Spanish buildings. A performer had lit a unique homemade contraption of flames and was whirling it about. I got back behind her and set up for this shot. from the blog www.stuckincustoms.com",

The Democrats&#39; approach, as always. <br /><br />The propaganda machine doesn&#39;t work outside the Fox studios. America is aware of the source of the current economic debt (Bush tax cuts, two unpaid for wars: See <a href=\"http://t.co/rj6vFXu\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://t.co/rj6vFXu</a>, <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3d62f7n\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://tinyurl.com/3d62f7n</a>, for a few examples out of the countless examples of these facts)... and we know which party is working for the people, and which is working for the corporations and rich. Which side is holding the process up trying to cut PELL GRANTS? Trying to make the middle class and elderly pay the bills while sticking up for the industry executives making record profits and <b>sitting</b> on their money, not creating a single job? (Because Reaganomics is a known historical failure.) Who&#39;s holding the nation and world hostage as economic terrorists? That&#39;s the Republicans, with their out-of-control (and out-of-their-minds-they-don&#39;t-have) Tea Party dolts who can&#39;t even debate high school students and win on matters of the constitution, government and economy.<br /><br />Since World War II, EVERY SINGLE Republican president has raised the Debt-to-GDP ratio (by moderate to large amounts) except two: Nixon, one term (obviously) and Eisenhower (two terms, and he&#39;s always attacked by the right wing). <br /><br />In the same time period, the number of Democratic presidents that have done the same? NONE. They&#39;ve ALL lowered the Debt-to-GDP ratio. <br /><br />Here&#39;s a little reminder to let that sink in: <br />Debt increase by presidents:<br /><br />Reagan 186%, Bush 54%, Clinton 41%, Bush II,  72%, Obama 23%. Source: CBO. (And that&#39;s not taking Bush&#39;s responsibility out of Obama&#39;s &quot;23%.&quot;)<br /><br />Why is it again that the debt ceiling was not an issue, nor challenged once by Conservatives, when Reagan raised it 18 times and Dubya 7 times? (<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3g57vsb\" class=\"ot-anchor\">http://tinyurl.com/3g57vsb</a>) This is the only time in US history a party has tied the debt ceiling to a balanced budget- it&#39;s preposterous and dangerous."

I am a novice photographer, self-taught, just enjoying the beauty of capturing an image and loving the artistry. A month ago, I felt my simpler comments were more welcome, but as the base grows, I&#39;m feeling less freedom to post my images for feedback. I know they aren&#39;t the level many elitist professionals look for, but they make me happy and i&#39;m here to admire and to learn. With a diverse audience we all can learn to appreciate the many perspectives that make this art form so universal. I am going to start a running &quot;blog&quot; of sorts on how I learn photography through the G+ photography community. I hope i&#39;ll receive joyous comments as well as some constructive feedback so I may learn and grow. Thank you, Trey, for your comments. I hope they are heard and considered widely as we continue to grow this lovely community."

I was just going through the pictures showing them off to my wife, and one after another were just producing gasps.  Wow, WOW, WOW!  Thanks so much for sharing.  Running around with my MkIV and doing 3-exposure HDR&#39;s that come out nothing like this, but still knowing how much work I put into them gives me even more wild appreciation for your artistry here.
