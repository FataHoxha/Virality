Riot police faced off with youths in fresh violence in London today in the third day of disorder after some of the worst rioting in the British capital in years at the weekend. The riots broke out in the north London district of Tottenham on August 6, following a protest against the death of a local man in a police shooting last week, and the violence spread to other parts of the city on August 7.
