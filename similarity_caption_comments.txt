Comment ---  ahh but the guy who spots the new way first no longer sits in obscurity for ten years before someone really notices this is not necessarily a kurzweil thing so much as a communication thing faster than ten years now i d think laston kirkland yes it is getting faster and faster but not by that much because it always takes people time to really see the new thing for what it really is interesting in that brad templeton just posted at http goo gl 6sppq about using m2m to facilitate the different world in a nice way that connected cars would bring about also i think it ties nicely into what www automatic com is trying to do in capitalizing on building a smartphone car interface maybe of interest to you professionally bill one idea i pitched to google ventures in an email a few years ago was to use a smart phone and its data recording abilities to analyze the roughness of the roads that people travel and then sell the data to governments or in a more capitalistic way sell the data to road repair facilities and let them try to get governments to pay for repairs on rough surfaces the possibilities with widely dispersed remote sensors are awesome and they make phone calls is there a video of your talk 
Comment clean ---  ahh guy spot new way longer sit obscurity year notice necessarily kurzweil thing communication thing faster year think laston kirkland yes faster faster people time new thing interesting brad templeton post http goo gl 6sppq use m2 facilitate different world nice way connected car bring think tie nicely www automatic com try capitalize build smartphone car interface maybe interest professionally bill idea pitch google venture email year ago use smart phone datum recording ability analyze roughness road people travel sell datum government capitalistic way sell datum road repair facility let try government pay repair rough surface possibility widely disperse remote sensor awesome phone video talk

Comment ---   patty dove mot really since its more than 10 of the total i tell my kids if you can not afford 20 you can not afford the food place now bad service does not get 20 and good service gets better 20 is always starting point not a good tip should be 5 at a minimum pretty cheap tip just sayin irrational wow i love it mindblowing lol yes phil kalina a very irrational tip wonderful 26 86 for a pie that must have been one nice pie does it come with a glass of bourbon wow i am in the states a rather affluent area and 15 is the standard here unless the server goes out of their way for a special request or otherwise above and beyond the call of duty if anything those who used to generally tip closer to 20 stopped doing so when the economy dove and they found their spendthrift ways aborted i ve almost never tipped 20 although exceptional service will not only gain a larger tip but also a specific compliment to the manager even if it means calling the next day in this case i would not be surprised if some cash was left separately from the plastic payment not so nice to the server who has to take your 3 14 i am sure they re saying thanks for the pennies a h0le in most us states 3 14 is pretty close to the food servers hourly rate if they do not receive any tips they rely on their tips their hourly rate usually does not even cover their health insurance premiums if they get any hahahaha brilliant clever and quite awesome agreed patty dove no it is not it is more than 10 of the whole amount so it is a fair tip ha a typical googlish approach to tipping see as i am from the states 4 pi would be more appropriate but still how geeky for those generous tippers the joke would be just as good if you put 2 it certainly varies from country to country i d never ever consider tipping 20 here 5 is more the norm and only if service is good no tip is quite acceptable for most places i am curious where in the us 20 is now considered to be the starting point i was raised the 15 was normal and 20 was for good service certainly more if the server is exceptional but this is the first i ve heard that 20 is now considered the starting point maybe this is a big city metropolitan thing that has not made it to the rest of the country yet thankfully for my family of four wallet here an 11 tip f you but that they know what pie is epic by 3 14 you can not round off a tip down that is a bad tip lucky reactive geek is it just my old food service days that have me thinking if you are going to leave a bad tip why be snarky about it morte oakley yes you re right it is not such a great tip albeit clever maybe he needed to leave 2 pi lt smile gt no the tip amount is pi is not it thus the tip is 3 14 this is very culturally specific in much of europe wages are higher and tips are lower watched an italian getting bawled out by a carmel waitress last weekend for leaving lt 10 he was genuinely puzzled her thought it was a fine amount to leave it is greater than 10 not sure about where you are but here that is a lot great it takes me back to an old joke she don t call me fat john has said i have an ideal shape he john is mathematician for every mathematician an ideal shape is a sphere just hope s he left some cash on the side to bump that tip up it is always better than i where the waiter would have to pay the customer a buck cheapskate lol i got the tip nice 2 pi tau its a crappy tip sorry but if i was that cheap i would not post it on line epic win i will remember this com n tip 20 at least just because you re clever does not mean you re allowed to be cheap only the lucky ones get to tip in pi amounts mathematician tips as clever as it is its still a shitty tip

Comment ---  jd gragg laptops nor cell phones work in secure locations in the white house or the pentagon or other known or unknown security installations even the republicans said no to john boehner this push is really about forcing the issue of raising taxes any wall fly reports on what boehner told the teaparty folk golf buddies i must have monitor troubles when i look at that photo all i see is our great president obama frustrated at being blocked from doing the right thing by ideologically stubborn corporatists the american flag an empty chair and then a large pile of orange sitting in front of a tea cup humorously without any tea bags to be seen where did speaker boehner go o_o looks like a fart contest if you ask me its no frustration alan gray yes the right thing the democrats approach as always the propaganda machine does not work outside the fox studios america is aware of the source of the current economic debt bush tax cuts two unpaid for wars see http t co rj6vfxu http tinyurl com 3d62f7n for a few examples out of the countless examples of these facts and we know which party is working for the people and which is working for the corporations and rich which side is holding the process up trying to cut pell grants trying to make the middle class and elderly pay the bills while sticking up for the industry executives making record profits and sitting on their money not creating a single job because reaganomics is a known historical failure who is holding the nation and world hostage as economic terrorists that is the republicans with their out of control and out of their minds they do not have tea party dolts who can not even debate high school students and win on matters of the constitution government and economy since world war ii every single republican president has raised the debt to gdp ratio by moderate to large amounts except two nixon one term obviously and eisenhower two terms and he is always attacked by the right wing in the same time period the number of democratic presidents that have done the same none they ve all lowered the debt to gdp ratio here is a little reminder to let that sink in debt increase by presidents reagan 186 bush 54 clinton 41 bush ii 72 obama 23 source cbo and that is not taking bush is responsibility out of obama is 23 why is it again that the debt ceiling was not an issue nor challenged once by conservatives when reagan raised it 18 times and dubya 7 times http tinyurl com 3g57vsb this is the only time in us history a party has tied the debt ceiling to a balanced budget it is preposterous and dangerous todd andelin the problems we ll face then are going to be the same ones whoever is holding the reins obama took on someone else is mess remember fascinating stuff ideology spent 3years on that alone sidebar certain personality types routinely vote against their self interests and i am not talking some fringe element of flakes i think it is interesting body language in this photo obama while seemingly disgusted and exasperated is still leaning towards boehner yet boehner is leaning away giving the impression that he wants nothing to do with obama can someone call the patriots owner mr robert kraft to come to the white house now staged just like the osama assassination war room photo the soviets weren t for naught our propaganda is more subtle you are correct as for the staged war room comment you must have also noticed that all the lap tops they were watching were off nice try but they are only wagging their own dog jaym esch doing the right thing you mean spending money like theres no tomorrow and no way to pay it back is the right thing i hope your wallet is fat because mine is almost empty well said jaym esch well said as the voice of a nation i d be frustrated too trying to fix an inherited problem when a speaker of a house is preventing me this is not a national issue it is an international problem as an australian my home loan repayments will rise as an australian company we re losing 30 revenue just purely because of a screwed us dollar add to that a loss of sales due to an almost bankrupt country not wanting to spend and its a dark dark picture tough problems require tough action and not everyone will like that why are they looking like they are going to fart hahaha this is a great picture oh washington i think a larger problem is somebody suggesting even half seriously we should frame judgments around on one out of context photograph good catch by jewel samad the snapper perfect timing those pursed lips and defeated eyes speak volumes caption we can not even afford a penny for their thoughts i think they both removed their ties in case of an emergency suicide hanging allan gray too bad you re not one of the top 1 they are doing better than ever of course that should also mean that our economy is also doing better than ever since they are the ones who grow american jobs right right someone welched on a bet brinkmanship or statesmanship i suspect a deal will be made this is just wonderful theatrics

Comment ---  as anyone seen evidence that parents know more than a government agency about raising kids at least most of the agency people have studied raising kids try to find parents who have studied how to raise teens i have very rare mostly seat of the pants and ad hoc training i ve had hundreds of teens in foster care junior achievement boy scout leader at age 12 and so on i like it this girl is amazing mark shark the dutch tried to block her and delayed for a year the number of youth lost at sea seems to be tiny relative to their numbers very rare amazing accomplishment but she was highly experienced and her parents saw her in action enough to trust her judgment still not for the average bay sailor jim preston as anyone seen evidence that parents know more than a government agency about raising kids no but i d like to see some evidence that the converse is true too ralph sevy prior to public education i do believe parents knew how to raise their children sure because we had extended families in those days and it was not uncommon for three generations of a family to live in the same home or at least in the immediate vicinity kids growing up learned how to care for their younger brethren that is not so true anymore kids who sail off shore with their parents tend to do great in school and due to contact with different cultures are better socially adjusted besides i would trust a 16 yo girl is judgment over an older boy is judgment something to do with brain development two issues i see one the idea that one becomes mature at an arbitray age set by law and the response by government that they somehow know what is best for someone rather that persons parents in the case prior to public education i do believe parents knew how to raise their children with all of the teens falling through the cracks in education and turning to drugs subversive cultures and just plain part of the x generation why not applaud a young woman who sets a goal accomplishes it and shows early leadership skills in a generation where few like her are seen i hate to play the devil is advocate here but is it really good for us to be glorifying this kind of thing next thing you know some overzealous parents are going to pushing their 12 year old to jet ski around the world in order to set some kind of new record remember dekker got herself into hot water in the indian ocean just a year ago when she lost her mast sailing solo child endangerment where are you now laura moriginal me gusta absolutely amazing can t wait for the book i loved tania abei is book she circumnavigated at 18 and was the youngest girl then married another solo sailor she met in the pacific hai non lagi santai nich ikut dech aku kayanya senang banget salam dari bandung sangkuriang bandung jawa barat indonesia qee facha

Comment ---  i need this image on my wall is there an image credit btw nailed it this depends on the particular skills business types with no open source experience are often terrible when they are in a position of authority over open source developers the profit model is entirely different and apparently incomprehensible unless they ve either seen it up close or have very carefully studied e g cygnus and rhat business models i spent a few years in the mid 90 is working on the design of fault tolerant organizations hoping to create information exchange pathways inside organizations that limited the harm that could be done through the loss or failure of any individual the large scale experiment the scaleable company that we were building pretty much failed ended up being rebuilt form the ground up on a different basis using contractor labor in part because i had neither identified nor solved these problems and in part because we were working inside an existing organizational structure and not all the systems for necessary decentralization and elimination of single points of failure could be implemented as much as the article is text the image you chose to illustrate it speaks to the most interesting approach to this problem i have seen anyone take to date about 20 years ago a good friend was running a nonprofit with a chronically dysfunctional board of directors he gained access to a big pulling boat 8 or 10 big oars on a lifeboat sized wooden hull i think it was a replica of one of the launches on capt vancouver is ship and he took the board out for a spin and steered them into serious currents way out in the bay and then disabled the rudder at which point they really had no choice other than a tow from the coast guard but to cooperate at a truly physical level to listen with their arms and backs and legs to one another is muscles on the other oars and coordinate their efforts if they were to get back to the harbor but whether or not a single experience like that can really change the way people deal with one another is another matter entirely correct any weaknesses in one are compensated in another and vice versa this is completely depend on determination and make the hay while sun shine great advise somebody is oar is not in the water i never rowed a 4cyl i believethat i would take alot of training to make this dragonfly move asone different skills are great but to move the water rocket above theybetter become one with the boat right now its hard for me tothink i miss my single shell very very much interesting different skills yet they are doing the same thing i think a more apt picture would have been a crane and construction crew i need this image on my wall is there an image credit btw nailed it this depends on the

Comment ---  i need this image on my wall is there an image credit btw nailed it this depends on the particular skills business types with no open source experience are often terrible when they are in a position of authority over open source developers the profit model is entirely different and apparently incomprehensible unless they ve either seen it up close or have very carefully studied e g cygnus and rhat business models i spent a few years in the mid 90 is working on the design of fault tolerant organizations hoping to create information exchange pathways inside organizations that limited the harm that could be done through the loss or failure of any individual the large scale experiment the scaleable company that we were building pretty much failed ended up being rebuilt form the ground up on a different basis using contractor labor in part because i had neither identified nor solved these problems and in part because we were working inside an existing organizational structure and not all the systems for necessary decentralization and elimination of single points of failure could be implemented as much as the article is text the image you chose to illustrate it speaks to the most interesting approach to this problem i have seen anyone take to date about 20 years ago a good friend was running a nonprofit with a chronically dysfunctional board of directors he gained access to a big pulling boat 8 or 10 big oars on a lifeboat sized wooden hull i think it was a replica of one of the launches on capt vancouver is ship and he took the board out for a spin and steered them into serious currents way out in the bay and then disabled the rudder at which point they really had no choice other than a tow from the coast guard but to cooperate at a truly physical level to listen with their arms and backs and legs to one another is muscles on the other oars and coordinate their efforts if they were to get back to the harbor but whether or not a single experience like that can really change the way people deal with one another is another matter entirely correct any weaknesses in one are compensated in another and vice versa this is completely depend on determination and make the hay while sun shine great advise somebody is oar is not in the water i never rowed a 4cyl i believethat i would take alot of training to make this dragonfly move asone different skills are great but to move the water rocket above theybetter become one with the boat right now its hard for me tothink i miss my single shell very very much interesting different skills yet they are doing the same thing i think a more apt picture would have been a crane and construction crew i need this image on my wall is there an image credit btw nailed it this depends on the

Comment ---  what is she doing very nice picture nice picture who cares about the hands what great eyes that is a great idea it is not hard to believe you can instantly see how out of focus the hands are that is the first part i looked at because there is no background to blend besides the hand in order to add those beads of water the perspective of the strand of water that was supposed to go between the hands is off too but the idea is great 
Comment clean ---  nice picture nice picture care hand great eye great idea hard believe instantly focus hand look background blend hand order add bead water perspective strand water suppose hand idea great

Comment ---  martin ockovsky i am not sure what your point is if i am selling cell phones i am going to target countries where there are a lot of people never mind the total of the population with a cell phone a sale is a sale if i can sell a billion cell phones in china vs having 5 5 million sales and dominating the slovakian market guess which one i am going to pick nice i never said that you are not bright and i did not mean it like that it is just whenever i see graphs like this i get annoyed oooo in china there is 1 bilion phones what a great market never mind that more then 300 million people still do not have any phone which is basically market the size of usa india the same so yeah there is shit load of sold phones in there but still huge and by huge i mean really huge chunk of market without any phone that is because those people are poor do you mean that based on this graph you can see business opportunity well good luck competing with cheap phones made in india and china i am from slovakia small country with population about 5 5 million so we would need 15 phones for every citizen to make that chart and i can notell you for a fact that there is more phones then citizens in slovakia so if you would take it by population phone ratio you would clearly get really different graph but it would not tell you anything either imho well if you do not know that the bigger market you have the bigger chance you have to sell the product then good morning largest countries by population china india us indonesia brazil pakistan nigeria bangladesh russia japan mexico philippines vietnam so i have to disagree bill gross especially since this is total number of cell phones and not internet enabled smartphones shouldn t the interesting figure be how many percent of the population that has a cell phone i mean for one thing wikipedia tells me that the population of france upper end of the graph wih less cell phones is 65 350 000 while the population of china lower end of the graph with more cell phones is 1 353 821 000 coupled with the almost unlimited computing power from the cloud available to smartphones through wireless connectivity the capability to see hear smell continuously will make our smartphones truly like a human companion lin zhong rice universitythe unequivocal trend is that more and more mobile phones will have access to the internet in the future the distriction between cell phone and smartphone will naturally blur as internet access will become a baseline feature for most any mobile phone scott ramsay i just read that there is a 59 unlocked smartphone in india it only has a 3 screen but that is still amazing we ve a ways to go but the fact that the prices are falling so fast and the features going up so fast is great i think erich feldmeier cell phones still need the ground based infrastructure most of the call is still traveling over landline it goes cellphone gt tower gt landline gt possibly satellite gt landline gt tower gt cellphone wireless communication is not all wireless and what percentage are so called smartphones bill gross what is your source for this data i would like to do some further study with this data bill gross thanks i absolutely agree i am sure there actually is a lot of truth in what you said in your original post it d be good to see a complete set of figures which answer all the questions that each of the others might individually not be able to answer it d also be useful to know the average cost of a cellphone in these countries if people in low gdp countries have access to cheap cheap phones then sure so what nothing really surprising there if they re buying galaxy s3s and iphones we might have a case for using the word amazingly erich feldmeier i guess i learned something new today yeah of course but i was reacting to this amazingly if you look at the top 20 countries by cell phones the list is dominated by many low gdp countries the list is not about the ratio of people owning phone it is based on the number of inhabitants so it is not surprising that countries with low gdp are dominating that list because they have the most inhabitants i really do not know what is hard to understand about that the postal mail revolution is democratic the street address revolution is democratic the silverware revolution is democratic the frying pan revolution is democratic and so on jason kalka thx of course but with lte you need not direct lines from communication partner to communication partner as before that seems a big advantage for countries with few people and related to that fiona spears of course larger countries will have more cellphones if this is about the democracy of people choosing to spend their money on cellphones the figures need to be expressed as a percentage of the total people in those countries who ve parted with their cash one small contributing factor is that the systems are so unstructured that things do not get through in these countries without a sustained barrage of followup phone calls a phone call in human voice still carries more weight than a traceable email in these parts of the world because an email costs almost nothing it is valued that much lesser just an interesting input to the trend how was this calculated many of these countries have more cell phones than citizens skipping technology from yesterday like cable infrastructure too expensive now in low developed countries of course where is saudi arabia what is the big deal isn t this basically correlated mostly to population thank god for once we do not rate which is surprising it is number of phones in countries not ratio between number of phones and number of inhabitants no shit that the countries which biggest amount of inhabitants have the biggest amount of phones this graph has no value what so ever is it because in those countries they rely on mobile devices replacing the domestic internet access it is the cheapest form of information and communication access in those countries russia brazil india and china are the bric countries with a faster growing number of internet users china being already number 1 also interesting to see would be the use of mobile phones for communication vs other tasks separated by g8 bric and other countries btw china india russia and brazil are in the top 10 gdp countries one second there there is no revolution without data access and data here in brazil costs around usd 5 megabyte and it is not broadly available everyone may have a smartphone but it is nothing more than a dead piece of expensive electronics a mobile phone is not a smart phone per se is this figure true smart phones are not important but the most important is the smart people martin ockovsky i am not

Comment ---  martin ockovsky i am not sure what your point is if i am selling cell phones i am going to target countries where there are a lot of people never mind the total of the population with a cell phone a sale is a sale if i can sell a billion cell phones in china vs having 5 5 million sales and dominating the slovakian market guess which one i am going to pick nice i never said that you are not bright and i did not mean it like that it is just whenever i see graphs like this i get annoyed oooo in china there is 1 bilion phones what a great market never mind that more then 300 million people still do not have any phone which is basically market the size of usa india the same so yeah there is shit load of sold phones in there but still huge and by huge i mean really huge chunk of market without any phone that is because those people are poor do you mean that based on this graph you can see business opportunity well good luck competing with cheap phones made in india and china i am from slovakia small country with population about 5 5 million so we would need 15 phones for every citizen to make that chart and i can notell you for a fact that there is more phones then citizens in slovakia so if you would take it by population phone ratio you would clearly get really different graph but it would not tell you anything either imho well if you do not know that the bigger market you have the bigger chance you have to sell the product then good morning largest countries by population china india us indonesia brazil pakistan nigeria bangladesh russia japan mexico philippines vietnam so i have to disagree bill gross especially since this is total number of cell phones and not internet enabled smartphones shouldn t the interesting figure be how many percent of the population that has a cell phone i mean for one thing wikipedia tells me that the population of france upper end of the graph wih less cell phones is 65 350 000 while the population of china lower end of the graph with more cell phones is 1 353 821 000 coupled with the almost unlimited computing power from the cloud available to smartphones through wireless connectivity the capability to see hear smell continuously will make our smartphones truly like a human companion lin zhong rice universitythe unequivocal trend is that more and more mobile phones will have access to the internet in the future the distriction between cell phone and smartphone will naturally blur as internet access will become a baseline feature for most any mobile phone scott ramsay i just read that there is a 59 unlocked smartphone in india it only has a 3 screen but that is still amazing we ve a ways to go but the fact that the prices are falling so fast and the features going up so fast is great i think erich feldmeier cell phones still need the ground based infrastructure most of the call is still traveling over landline it goes cellphone gt tower gt landline gt possibly satellite gt landline gt tower gt cellphone wireless communication is not all wireless and what percentage are so called smartphones bill gross what is your source for this data i would like to do some further study with this data bill gross thanks i absolutely agree i am sure there actually is a lot of truth in what you said in your original post it d be good to see a complete set of figures which answer all the questions that each of the others might individually not be able to answer it d also be useful to know the average cost of a cellphone in these countries if people in low gdp countries have access to cheap cheap phones then sure so what nothing really surprising there if they re buying galaxy s3s and iphones we might have a case for using the word amazingly erich feldmeier i guess i learned something new today yeah of course but i was reacting to this amazingly if you look at the top 20 countries by cell phones the list is dominated by many low gdp countries the list is not about the ratio of people owning phone it is based on the number of inhabitants so it is not surprising that countries with low gdp are dominating that list because they have the most inhabitants i really do not know what is hard to understand about that the postal mail revolution is democratic the street address revolution is democratic the silverware revolution is democratic the frying pan revolution is democratic and so on jason kalka thx of course but with lte you need not direct lines from communication partner to communication partner as before that seems a big advantage for countries with few people and related to that fiona spears of course larger countries will have more cellphones if this is about the democracy of people choosing to spend their money on cellphones the figures need to be expressed as a percentage of the total people in those countries who ve parted with their cash one small contributing factor is that the systems are so unstructured that things do not get through in these countries without a sustained barrage of followup phone calls a phone call in human voice still carries more weight than a traceable email in these parts of the world because an email costs almost nothing it is valued that much lesser just an interesting input to the trend how was this calculated many of these countries have more cell phones than citizens skipping technology from yesterday like cable infrastructure too expensive now in low developed countries of course where is saudi arabia what is the big deal isn t this basically correlated mostly to population thank god for once we do not rate which is surprising it is number of phones in countries not ratio between number of phones and number of inhabitants no shit that the countries which biggest amount of inhabitants have the biggest amount of phones this graph has no value what so ever is it because in those countries they rely on mobile devices replacing the domestic internet access it is the cheapest form of information and communication access in those countries russia brazil india and china are the bric countries with a faster growing number of internet users china being already number 1 also interesting to see would be the use of mobile phones for communication vs other tasks separated by g8 bric and other countries btw china india russia and brazil are in the top 10 gdp countries one second there there is no revolution without data access and data here in brazil costs around usd 5 megabyte and it is not broadly available everyone may have a smartphone but it is nothing more than a dead piece of expensive electronics a mobile phone is not a smart phone per se is this figure true smart phones are not important but the most important is the smart people martin ockovsky i am not sure what your point is if i am selling cell phones i am going to target countries where there are a lot of people never mind the total of the population with a cell phone a sale is a sale if i can
